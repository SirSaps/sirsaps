## 👨‍💻 Whoami

  <samp>
    I have been passionate about programming since I was 12 years old.
    <br>
    Throughout my life I have worked with a variety of languages ​​and paradigms.
    <br>
    I have now reached a certain maturity to consider myself a full stack developer, 
    <br>
    although I have a strong orientation towards the backend.
